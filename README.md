1. Introduction 
For this project we are planning to develop a point of sale application, like one a retailer or restaurant would use. This topic is interesting for us as a group as it is something we deal with almost daily, sometimes as a user and other times as a customer. From a software engineering perspective, this project will be both interesting and challenging as it will allow for the implementation of as many functionalities as time allows. With the various possible operations a typical PoS application can perform, from returns to markdowns and inventory checking, our group can continue refining the product after finishing the core project. This project will be a great opportunity for us to learn and utilize agile development methods as this program’s requirements will inherently change as we complete more and more of the application. 

2. Project Description
As stated before, this will be a point of sale application similar to the ones used by both large and small retailers. At its heart the program will perform basic cash transactions: looking up a product by a given UPC or SKU number, pulling and displaying the price as a subtotal, applying relevant taxes and accepting payment, and calculating change due back to the customer based off the cash tendered. From there we will implement stock checking and return processing capabilities as well as the ability to apply discounts and markdowns. 

3. Key Features 
● Look up an item by a given SKU or UPC number 
● Provide an easy to use graphical interface 
● Display pricing and allow quantity adjustments 
● Calculate necessary taxes and change due back to customer after payment 
● Allow printing or email of purchase receipt 
● Decrement stock of item with purchase and increment stock with return 
● Allow for discounts and markdowns to be applied to items
